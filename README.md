# Pomodoro Timer for ESP32-C6

A Pomodoro timer application designed for the Waveshare ESP32-C6 with 1.47 inch display.

## Overview

This project implements a Pomodoro Technique timer on the ESP32-C6 microcontroller, utilizing the Waveshare 1.47 inch display for visual feedback. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
